# Summary of Issues Found

## server.js
- No error handling for database connection failures.

## models/exercise.js
- Inconsistent model naming: should be consistent as `Details`.
- Email validation regex is incorrect.
- HealthStatus validation should use an array format.
- BMIIndex validation has a typo with `MAX`.

## routes/exerciseRoutes.js
- PUT route should use `:id` instead of `:name` for better identification.
- Generic error messages could be improved for debugging.

## Recommendations
1. Implement error handling in `server.js` for database connection.
2. Fix validation issues in `models/exercise.js`.
3. Update the PUT route in `routes/exerciseRoutes.js` to use `:id`.
4. Ensure consistent naming conventions across the codebase.
